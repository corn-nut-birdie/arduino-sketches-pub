Yet another RC car's sketches. 

Both the sketches of the remote controller, and the RC car.

With 
- NRF24L01 as the radio modules for transmitter and receiver;
- a Wii Nunchuk as the ..__controller__ on the RC controller, connected to a simple _wiichuk_ module that convert the plug of the Wii Nunchuk to 2.54mm gpio pins.
