Yet another RC car's sketches. 

Both the sketches of the remote controller, and the RC car, that utilizes the joystick on the Wii Nunchuk for driving and ..pivot steering.
Tried pwm driven but dropped, when it produced interference.

With 
- NRF24L01 as the radio modules for transmitter and receiver;
- a Wii Nunchuk as the ..__controller__ on the RC controller, connected to a simple _wiichuk_ module that convert the plug of the Wii Nunchuk to 2.54mm gpio pins.
