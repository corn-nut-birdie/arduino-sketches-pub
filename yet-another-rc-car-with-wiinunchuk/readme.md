Yet another RC car's sketches. With NRF24L01 as the radio modules for transmitter and receiver; a Wii Nunchuk as the ..__controller__ on the RC controller, connected to a simple wiichuk module that convert the plug of the Wii Nunchuk to 2.54mm gpio pins.

Both the sketches of the remote controller, and the RC car.
